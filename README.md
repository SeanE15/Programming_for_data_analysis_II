### <div align="center">Introduction</div>

Hello, and welcome to my github repository. This repository has been created in order to satify the work required to complete the Programming for Data Analysis course - which is a key part to my completion of the HDip in Computer Science with Data Analytics at the Atlantic Technological University. This repository contains 1 folder which holds the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset (Original), The Assignment itself in Jupyter Notebook form, The breast-cancer-wisconsin.names text file which is required ot be uploaded as part of using the dataset, this readme file and a wdbc.names text file.

---- 

**The breakdown of the 'Assignment' Jupyter Notebook content is as follows:**

[1] Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset description
[2] Dataset Information
[3] Literature Review
    - Glossary of ML Acronyms
[4] What is Breast Cancer?
    - Database Terms
    - Types of Cancer
[5] Introduction to the Data

## <div align="center">System Requirements</div>

To modify or run the notebooks on a local machine requires the latest version of Python. Anaconda is an easy to use version available at the following URL's for Windows, Mac and Linux. Alternatively the static and interactive web based versions of the notebooks are available via the links below.

## <div align="center">Jupyter Notebooks </div>

#### In order to create/modify/view a Jupyter Notebook, Python and Jupyter Notebook must be installed on your device.

Python and jupyter lab are needed to run the .ipnb files in this repository.

[1] Download Python from https://www.python.org/.

[2] Type pip install jupyterlab and press enter.

[3] Follow the steps below to runthe notebook.

Please see the official [Installation](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html) of Jupyter Lab page if you are having issues.

#### To run the notebooks on a local machine following the installation of python you should do the following:

[1] Open the command line on your machine. I recommend CMDer if using Windows, but the native terminal works fine on Linux/Mac.

[2] Navigate to the appropriate folder that contains the notebook that is linked with your github account.

[3] Type "Jupyter notebook" and press "Enter"

[4] Your browser should automatically start and open up in the jupyter notebook program, if it doesn't a URL link should display on the cmder screen. 

[5] Click on Kernel and then select Restart Kernal and Run All Cells. This will start the notebook.

[6] When finished, close the tab in your browser and then press press 'ctrl + C' in the command prompt (I use CMDer) to end the session.
